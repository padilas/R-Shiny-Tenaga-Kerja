# Dynamic Dashboard: Labour Data Visualization (2020-2021)

This repository provides a **dynamic dashboard** built using **R-Shiny**, designed to visualize Labour data sourced from **BPS Indonesia** for 2020-2021. The dashboard aims to provide clear and interactive insights into key aspects of Indonesia's labor force. 

## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard is organized into two primary sections:  
1. **17 Sectors of Employment**  
   Visualizes workforce distribution across Indonesia's 17 employment sectors, enabling users to explore trends and patterns.  

2. **Primary Employment Status**  
   Highlights the breakdown of labor status, such as laborers/employees, self-employed, and other classifications, offering a comprehensive view of types of employment.

## Features and Functionality

### User Interface (UI)
The dashboard includes interactive elements to elevate user experience, including the following input components:
- **Radio Buttons**: Provides toggle functionality for specific data views.
- **Select Input**: Enables dropdown selections to filter data dynamically.

### Server-Side Visualization
The server processes data and generates visuals using the **ggplot2** package, ensuring:
- Charts and graphs are customized to the dataset.
- Visual clarity and relevancy for effective interpretation.
- Dynamically updated visualizations based on user inputs.

### Creativity and Additional Elements
To elevate usability and aesthetics, we have integrated additional features, including:
- **Responsive Layout**: Ensures compatibility across devices and screen sizes.
- **Inbox**: In this dashboard, this feature stores the group's names and its members.
- **Notifications**

## Learning Objectives
This project was designed to fulfill academic requirements while allowing us to develop skills in:
- **Data visualization** using R and ggplot2.
- Building **dynamic and responsive dashboards** with R-Shiny.
- Applying creativity in UI design to improve user engagement.
